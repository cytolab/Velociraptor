# Velociraptor

### Velociraptor publication: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cyto.a.70066

Velociraptor seeks cells based on a user-defined phenotype. With VR-Eye, cell identity can be defined based on phenotypic comparisons with well-established cell identities to assess if a population strongly matches a single cell type or if it has similarity with multiple populations. VR-Eye also enables automated cross-platform cell identification.

**Velociraptor Overview.** a) Velociraptor seeks cells based on a user-defined reference phenotype using MEM label syntax where “+0” indicates a feature that is specifically lacking from a target population (e.g., no expression in that population) and “+10” indicates a feature that is specifically present in that population (e.g., high, uniform expression in all cells of that population). The phenotype for every cell in a dataset is calculated using that cell and its closest phenotypic neighbors (CELL), identified using k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).  The difference between the sought reference phenotype (REF) and the cell’s phenotype is calculated using root mean square deviation (RMSD) and recorded as a per-cell feature. This is repeated for each reference population supplied as input. b) Velociraptor similarity scores can be visualized per-cell and plotted in the coordinate space of the original image. In this example, cells are shaded according to their degree of matching the specified B cell reference population. A spectrum intensity scale indicates cell similarity with red indicating high similarity and purple indicating low similarity.

Velociraptor was developed in the laboratory of Dr. Jonathan Irish at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. The research was supported by the following funding resources: NIH/NCI grants R01 NS118580 (JMI, RAI, AAB), R01 CA226833 (JMI, CEC), U01 AI125056 (JMI), U54 CA217450 (JMI), T32GM137793 (CEC), by the Vanderbilt Center for Immunobiology, and by the Ben & Catherine Ivy Foundation Emerging Leader Award (RAI, JMI).
